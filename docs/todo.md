# TODO LIST

1. The encryption key must be divided into 3 parts (`holder`, `albus`, `trusty`)
  - Shamir algo
  - Double ecdh

2. Investigate Sparse-Merkle-Tree (SMT), Incremental-Merkle-Tree (IMT)
  - Check if root can be regenerated without knowledge of the whole tree

---

# Think about
1. How to update merkle without transaction history?
2. Sharing keys and collecting keys without a trusted person
