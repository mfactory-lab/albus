# TODO LIST

1. The encryption key must be divided into 3 parts (`holder`, `albus`, `trusty`)
  - Shamir algo
  - Double ecdh

2. Investigate Sparse-Merkle-Tree (SMT), Incremental-Merkle-Tree (IMT)
  - Check if root can be regenerated without knowledge of the whole tree

# Implement programs

token transfer
spl token swap (AMM)
spl stake pool (check permission less pool)
liquid stacking
smart converter (integrate albus)

# Think about
1. How to update merkle without transaction history?
2. Sharing keys and collecting keys without a trusted person

# AML Integration

Score calculation
Chainlink

# Duplicate Search Mechanism

We should know that if one person made 20 verifications
- Compare passport numbers
- Easiest way to hash the passport code
