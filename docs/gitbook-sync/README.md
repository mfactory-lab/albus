# What is Albus Protocol?

A highly adaptable infrastructure for monetizable decentralized identities (DID), providing privacy and compliance tools for secure identity verification

## Problem

The shift to digital identity has created new challenges in managing identities. Traditional identity systems rely on centralized infrastructure, which leads to inefficiencies, security risks, and lack of user control. Each business has to independently build and maintain its own identity management system, resulting in redundant, siloed solutions. Centralized storage exposes sensitive data to breaches and unauthorized access, while users have little to no control over it.

## Solution

Albus provides a decentralized identity (DID) infrastructure that addresses the inefficiencies of traditional centralized systems while introducing a [revenue-sharing model](revenue-sharing-model.md) for identity monetization. With [Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)](self-sovereign-identity.md), users have full control over their identity data, and blockchain-enabled decentralization removes the need for centralized storage, enhancing security and minimizing risks. Albus also enables reusability, allowing identities to be easily shared across platforms and reducing redundancy.

By combining these core features with compliance and privacy tools, Albus creates a secure environment where identities can be openly or privately verified for compliance with any requirements across a wide range of use cases both in Web2 and in Web3. These include KYC/KYB/KYT, due diligence, and proof-of-funds (PoF) checks, NFT-based point systems, member club cards, user profiling and verification in tokenized asset trading.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Albus Protocol is designed as a **blockchain-agnostic** solution, which means it can be deployed on any public blockchain, regardless of whether it's EVM-compatible or not. Currently, it's deployed on Solana.
* The architecture of Albus has been designed to guarantee **service continuity**, even beyond the lifespan of the initial company that coded and deployed Albus.
