# Use cases

Albus can be leveraged by any Web3 business that needs reliable verification, whether it’s a monetary project, such as a DeFi protocol, or a non-monetary one, for example a metaverse.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

* **DeFi platforms seeking new liquidity**: Albus makes sure every user has passed KYC verification—an integral part of AML compliance required so that regulated traditional finance and institutional players can make their liquidity available on blockchain.
* **Security token traders**: Tokenisers of real-world and illiquid assets, or any other security token traders, must comply with KYC/AML regulations to be able to operate on public blockchains. Albus’s ZK-based KYC is an important part of these regulations.
* **Undercollateralized lending services**: These lending platforms can use Albus for scoring users and improving risk management performance, ultimately making their way to secondary loan markets.
* **Any DeFi platform that wants a future-proof business**: Soon, new regulations will start to apply in practice in the DeFi space. Any DeFi platform looking to operate in the new regulatory environment will have to put new compliance practices in place. Albus can facilitate that.

## Other industries

* **FinTechs requiring PoF verification**: FinTech and any other platforms that require Proof-of-Funds (PoF) verification can integrate Albus to make sure that their users have enough money to be eligible for a transaction or a service, without demanding access to sensitive data.
* **Logistics and transportation industry**: Albus provides these companies with a solution to identify suppliers (KYS) and assets, track shipments, prevent counterfeiting, control quality, monitor compliance, etc.
* **Retailers of restricted goods**: With Albus, these retailers can make sure each sale they make via a public blockchain is compliant, for example alcohol is sold only to customers of legal age.
* **Metaverses and GameFi projects**: As Metaverses and on-chain gaming projects usually involve financial transactions, such as sale of virtual assets, they need to be sure their users are of legal age. Albus offers an additional compliance layer through KYC verification of such users.
* **Web 2.0 projects**: Albus can become a valuable verification tool for any Web 2.0 platform that needs to know their users but wants to maintain a privacy-oriented approach.
