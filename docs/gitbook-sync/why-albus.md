# Benefits

Albus Protocol opens up a number of attractive business opportunities and potential improvements for Web3 companies:

* **Target users and personalize offering**: knowing user demographics means improved targeting and personalization.
* **Mitigate user-associated risks**: privacy-preserving identification of users can mitigate the risk of exploitation and hacker attacks for smart contracts.
* **Institutional capital and security token trading**: an AML compliance solution incorporating Albus's zkKYC capability could help in attracting liquidity from institutionals and TradFi, or serve as a point of entry into the rapidly growing market of security tokens, such as tokenised RWAs.
* **Future-proof business**: as AML regulations tighten, DeFi businesses are increasingly pressured into proactively making business compliant with KYC and KYT requirements.
